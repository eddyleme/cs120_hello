<h2>O Trek</h2>
<p>
	This past winter break I visited Torres Del Paine park in Chile with my girlfriend and her father.
	Torres Del Paine is in the southern part of Patagonia and on the edge of the South Patagonian Ice Field, the largest ice field on earth outside of the poles.
	We walked an 80 mile circuit over 8 days and saw a few glaciers in the park.
	The ice field is often covered in clouds, but we lucked out with some clear skies when we passed it.

<h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
<p>I love eating at 'O Munaciello in Miami because they have a great gluten free pizza. The restaurant also has a great buratta and an excellent branzino. The food is reasonably priced and there usually are open tables at dinner time. The restaurant offers take out as well. Their website is <a href="https://www.munaciello.com/coral-way/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
<div id="stroganoff-image"></div><div id="stroganoff-text"><p>My favorite food is Brazilian Stroganoff. I like it with either steak or chicken and made with fresh mushrooms (some people prefer canned). I also like it with potato sticks on top and with a side of salad. I usually put extra salt and pepper on top of it as well.</p></div>
